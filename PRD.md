### **Product Requirements Document: AI Medication Scanner & History**

This document outlines the requirements for a new feature set within our existing Pet Health application: the AI-powered "Scan-to-Add" medication tool and the accompanying "Medication History & Export" function.

#### **1. Project Specifics**

| **Participants** | **Product Owner:** [Your Name/Project Lead] |
| :--- | :--- |
| | **Development Team:** AI/ML Engineers, Mobile App Devs, Cloud Engineer |
| | **Stakeholders:** Head of Product, CTO, Head of Insurance Operations, Customer Support Lead |
| **Status** | ðŸŸ¢ **Draft** |
| **Target Release** | **Feature Flag Rollout:** (End of Day, Friday, July 18, 2025) |

#### **2. Team Goals and Business Objectives**

**Team Goals:**
*   Successfully integrate the "Scan-to-Add" feature into the existing mobile app.
*   Develop a reliable medication history log that is automatically populated by user actions.
*   Implement a simple, effective "Export to PDF" function for sharing medication history.

**Business Objectives:**
*   Increase user engagement within our app by providing a high-value, high-frequency use case (daily medication logging).
*   Enhance the quality and depth of our data by capturing structured information on specific medications, dosages, and adherence patterns.
*   Improve customer satisfaction and stickiness by solving a major pain point for pet owners who manage chronic conditions or complex treatments for their pets.

#### **3. Background and Strategic Fit**

Our app has successfully engaged users around their pet's basic profile and insurance policy. The next strategic step is to deepen that engagement by becoming an indispensable daily tool for pet health management. The single biggest opportunity is in medication management.

By introducing the AI Medication Scanner, we are not just adding a feature; we are transforming a manual, error-prone task into an effortless, even "magical" experience. This will serve as a powerful hook to bring users back to the app daily. The subsequent Medication History log provides the long-term value, creating a concrete health record that empowers owners during vet visits and streamlines potential insurance claims. This feature directly supports our goal of evolving into a data-first pet health company.

#### **4. Assumptions**

*   **Technical:**
    *   We have access to Google's Gemini Pro API and can engineer a prompt that reliably returns a structured JSON object from a medication label image.
    *   The existing app has a component-based architecture that allows for the clean insertion of a new user flow (the scanner).
    *   We have a robust, existing user authentication and pet profile system to build upon.
    *   A native PDF generation library can be quickly integrated into our mobile codebase for the export feature.
*   **User:**
    *   Our existing users are managing their pet's medications and will see immediate value in a tool that simplifies this task.
    *   Users desire a simple way to track and share their pet's medication history with their veterinarians.

#### **5. User Stories**

**Epic 1: Effortless Medication Logging**

*   **As a pet owner using the app,** I want to see a clear "Add Medication" button on my pet's main dashboard, so I can easily start the process.
*   **As a pet owner,** I want to choose the "Scan with Camera" option to open my phone's camera and take a picture of my pet's medication label.
*   **As a pet owner,** after taking a photo, I want the app to show me a pre-filled confirmation screen with the medication's name, dosage, and frequency, so I can verify the AI's accuracy.
*   **As a pet owner,** once I confirm the details, I want the medication to be added to my pet's active medication list and for reminders to be automatically scheduled.

**Epic 2: Medication Adherence and History**

*   **As a pet owner,** I want to receive a push notification when a medication is due, so I don't forget.
*   **As a pet owner,** from the notification or in the app, I want to tap a button to confirm "Dose Administered," so I can easily log my actions.
*   **As a pet owner,** I want to view a "History" screen that shows a clear, time-stamped log of every medication dose I have administered, so I can track adherence over time.
*   **As a pet owner viewing the history,** I want to tap an "Export" or "Share" button, so I can generate a shareable document for my vet.
*   **As a pet owner,** I want the exported file to be a clean, simple PDF document that I can easily send via email, text, or other apps.

**Success Metrics:**
*   **Feature Engagement Rate:** At least 30% of weekly active users engage with the medication scanning or logging feature.
*   **Medications Logged:** A target of over 500 new medications are added by users via the scan feature within the first month of launch.
*   **History Export Usage:** The "Export History" function is used at least once by 10% of the feature's active users, indicating they find the data valuable enough to share.

#### **6. User Interaction and Design**

**Flow:** The user navigates from the main dashboard to the scanner, and can later view the results in the history screen.

```
Upon tapping `+ Add New Medication`, the user is taken to the **Camera View** and **AI Confirmation Screen** as previously defined.

#### **7. Questions**

| Question | Owner | Due Date |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| What is the final data structure for the exported PDF? What fields must it include? | Product Owner | EOD Day 1 |
| How far back should the medication history be viewable/exportable in this MVP? (e.g., 30 days, all-time) | Product Owner | EOD Day 2 |
| How do we handle "skipped" or "missed" doses in the history log? | Design/Product | EOD Day 2 |

#### **8. What We're Not Doing**

To integrate this feature set (Scanner + History + Export) within the aggressive timeline, we are explicitly de-scoping the following:

*   **No Manual Medication Entry:** The AI scanner remains the only method to add a new medication.
*   **No Editing the History Log:** The log is an immutable record of confirmed doses. Users cannot go back and change past entries in this MVP.
*   **No Complex Export Formats:** The only export option will be a standardized PDF. We will not support CSV, XLS, or custom formats.
*   **No In-App Analytics:** The app will not provide graphs or charts visualizing adherence. That will be reserved for a future release.
