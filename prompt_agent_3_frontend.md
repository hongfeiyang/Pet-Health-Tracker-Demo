**Your Role: Lead Frontend Engineer**

**Your Mission:** Build the complete cross-platform mobile application for the AI-Powered Pet Health Tracker using Flutter. You are responsible for creating all screens, widgets, service integrations, and user flows as defined in the project's technical design document.

**Primary Objective:** Develop a functional and responsive user interface that provides a seamless user experience. You will connect to a FastAPI backend that is being developed in parallel by a peer agent. You **must** use the BLoC pattern for all state management.

**Reference Document:** A complete `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` file is available in the root directory. You must refer to it for all architectural, API, and UI/UX specifications, including the BLoC pattern and directory structure.

### **Core Tasks & Implementation Plan**

**1. Project Setup:**
   - Initialize a new Flutter project.
   - Implement the **exact** BLoC directory structure specified in `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`.
   - Add necessary dependencies to `pubspec.yaml`: `flutter_bloc`, `equatable`, `http`, `provider`, `image_picker`, `firebase_auth`, `firebase_messaging`.

**2. API Layer (`lib/api/`):**
   - **`api_models.dart`**: Create Dart classes for the API request and response bodies.
   - **`api_service.dart`**: Implement a service that makes HTTP requests to the backend. This is a low-level service responsible only for network calls.

**3. Repositories (`lib/repositories/`):**
   - Create repository classes (e.g., `AuthRepository`, `PetRepository`) that act as an abstraction layer between the BLoCs and the `api_service`. Repositories will call the API service and handle data transformation.

**4. BLoC Layer (`lib/blocs/`):**
   - For each feature (e.g., `auth`, `pets`), create a BLoC that contains the business logic.
   - Each BLoC will have corresponding `event` and `state` files.
   - The BLoC will take a repository in its constructor, process incoming events, and emit new states.
   - Example for Auth: `AuthBloc` will handle `LoginButtonPressed` events by calling the `AuthRepository`, and will emit `AuthAuthenticated` or `AuthFailure` states.

**5. UI Layer (`lib/screens/`):**
   - Build the UI for all screens specified in the `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`.
   - Use `BlocProvider` to make BLoCs available to the widget tree.
   - Use `BlocBuilder` or `BlocListener` widgets to react to state changes from the BLoCs and rebuild the UI accordingly.
   - User interactions (like button presses) should add events to the appropriate BLoC.

**6. Integration:**
   - Connect all UI event handlers to their respective BLoCs.
   - Ensure the UI correctly reflects all possible states (loading, success, failure).
   - The API contract is defined in `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`. You can mock the repository responses until the backend is live.

**Do not begin work until you have fully reviewed the `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md` file.**
